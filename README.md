# Hi, I'm Nicolas :wave:

Recovering swim geek turned into aspiring tech nerd.
Hailing from the pool deck with over a decade of experience coaching athletes
to the highest level towards the fast moving web development space.
Recently completed the Le Wagon [Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com/web-development-course)
to refresh and upskill a dusty degree in Business Information Technology.
Ready to take on challenges as **fullstack developer** with a bias towards the **frontend**.

## :gem: Skills

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, PostgreSQL, SQL, Ruby on Rails

## :headphones: Listening

I like to listen to a variety of Podcasts to stay up to date
with current web development (languages, frameworks, tools, ...) and related trends.

ShopTalk Show, Smashing Podcast, Syntax, Jukebox (WP Tavern),
For Mac Eyes Only, SEO 101

## :bulb: Learning
