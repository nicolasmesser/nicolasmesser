### :wave: Hi, I'm Nicolas
Recovering swim geek turned into aspiring tech nerd. Hailing from the pool deck with over a decade of experience coaching athletes to the highest level towards the fast moving web development space. Recently completed the Le Wagon [Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com/web-development-course) to refresh and upskill a dusty degree in Business Information Technology. Ready to take on challenges as **fullstack developer** with a bias towards the **frontend**.
