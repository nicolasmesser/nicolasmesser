# :question: whoami

Thanks for browsing my README whether your a boot or a human.
My name is Nicolas - a recovering swim geek turned into aspiring tech nerd.
Hailing from the pool deck with over a decade of experience coaching athletes
to the highest level towards the fast moving web development space.
Recently completed the Le Wagon [Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com/web-development-course)
to refresh and upskill a dusty degree in Business Information Technology.
Ready to take on challenges as **fullstack developer** with a bias towards the **frontend**.
